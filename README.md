# Revolution RPG

![](/logos/logo_black_vignette_JPG.jpg)

**Revolution RPG** is an atypical roleplaying gamemode in Arma 3.

## Why does this project exist?

It's key areas of focus are:

- _light_, arcade roleplay that's still fun for everyone, including new players
- allowing as much _creativity_ by players as possible
- minimal ruleset by default
- _fast_ progression
- _endgame_
- lots of PvP action.

Another important aspect of Revolution RPG is that it returns the control of the game back to players: e.g. leaders ingame are voted by the players.

The ultimate goal of this project is to bring back the Arma 2 style, mindset and feel of RPG/Life gameplay with improved feature set.
